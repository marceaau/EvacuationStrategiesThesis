# EvacuationStrategiesThesis

This github repository present all the code and models used to evaluate the effectiveness of evacuation strategies based on WiFi data. The notebooks in the main folder are used to run the experiments with the EMA package and to visualize the data afterwards (data in the results folder), these files can be recognized by their logical order presented by the numbers 01 to 04. Inside these python notebook files, the visualization, calculation and extraction of the data produced by the model can be found.

## Net logo Model

Inside the model folder the NetLogo model can be found in the file model.nlogo. To execute this file, the software NetLogo should be installed. The software can be downloaded from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml. To run the model, one opens the NetLogo file and presses the 'set up' button in the GUI, afterwards press the go button to simulate the model. 

### Validity of the model

To validate the model, several submodels were created. These can be found in the validity folder together with the files to explore the results (inside the results folder). 

## WiFi data

Inside the cysco_api folder, the execution of the retrieval of the WiFi data can be found. This consumer can not be run anymore, as the access to the platform was only allowed for one month (due to privacy reasons).
